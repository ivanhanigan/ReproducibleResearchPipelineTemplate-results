## README

This is a collection of results that I publish using the ONS-SCD model (Open Notebook Science: Selected Content - Delayed).
I've kept a log of all work in a local repo I keep private, and I only use this to publish results when I feel they are ready.

The structure is:

```
/main_project_folder/
   /.git (this is the local repo, just for the orgmode file, gitignore is set to ignore all others)
   /main.org
   /data
      /file1
      /file2
   /code
      /func.R
   /results
      /.git (this is the Public Github repo, for selectively publishing the results)
      /README.md
      /YYYY-MM-DD_a_short_descriptor
      /YYYY-MM-DD_shortname
```
